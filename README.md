# DonutStack

DonutStack is a casual match-3 game developed in Unity. The player shoots pyramid stacks into rows, each holding up to 3 colorful donuts. When a stack reaches the end of the row, donuts try to jump onto nearby stacks with matching colors and available space. If a stack collects three donuts of the same color, it collapses and clears space — earning the player points.
